# Model selection for model "auto": which model a project gets when it lets the
# platform choose. agentgateway asks this through a callout virtual model:
#
#   POST /v1/data/gateway/select/result
#   {"input": {"project": "<id>", "task": "<class>"}}   task is optional
#   → {"result": {"model": "<name>", "routing": "<rule>"}}
#
# The answer is always one of lib.allowed(project): selection never widens what
# authorization allows. An unknown project, or one with no allowed model, gets
# no result, and the gateway answers 503.
